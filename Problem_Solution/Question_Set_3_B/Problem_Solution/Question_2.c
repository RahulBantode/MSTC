Columb's Law A particle can be positively changed
negatively charged or neutral Columb's law governs
the force between the changed particles Like changes tot or
repel each other and opposite changes s t on
attract each other The magnitude of force of
attraction or repusion is governed by the following
equation

    F = k.q1.q2 / r2 where
    k = Coluamb's constant =  8.988 * 10^9
    q1 , q2 = Charges on particles with sign  (positiviely charged particle will have positive sign)
              (negatively charged particle will have negative sign)

    r = distance between the charges

    write a program which will accept -
    1.  accept the q1,q2 (with sign) and r from the user.
    2.  print the magnitude of the force.
    3.  state whether the force is that of attraction or repulsion.
